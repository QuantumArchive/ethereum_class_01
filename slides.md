# What are we learning today?

What are we learning today?
- Basic installations 
- how to create a private ethereum chain 
- how to setup a dev environment 
- your first smart contract 

What tools do we need
- Npm
- Geth
- Mist, ethereum wallet
- A text editor (atom, sublime, jetbrains)

# The Installs

Install npm for your system
https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

Install truffle and testrpc:
npm install -g truffle ethereumjs-testrpc

At this point you are ready, but we will add more for fun.

Install geth 
https://www.ethereum.org/cli

_Note: use homebrew on a Mac to install npm, geth, and testrpc_


# Make your own dang chain.

# All the Truffles



Metacoin!



# Metacoin to the MOON!

`truffle init webpack`

From there, you can run `truffle compile`, `truffle migrate` and `truffle test` to compile your contracts, deploy those contracts to the network, and run their associated unit tests

# Some final thoughts

a call: read data [no cost]
a transaction: write (change network state) [cost gas]

More transactions = more gas

Metamask, and web3.js
Example: ENS domains.
